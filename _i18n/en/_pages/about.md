I am Xia(夏宋鹏程- in Chinese, Pronounce), currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (**Ph.D. National Scholarship**), focusing on the research of wearable-based human motion reconstruction and human activity recognition. My doctoral journey is under the guidance of [Prof.Ling Pei](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=Vm7d2EkAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW&oi=sra), and meanwhile, I worked closely with [Dr.Lei Chu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=HgZ0wNwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&authuser=1&sortby=pubdate). Previously, I obtained the Bachelor’s degree in Navigation Engineering at Wuhan University (**National Scholarship,Outstanding graduates, Top 1% Award of Wuhan University**).

Most recently, I am currently deeply engaged in three areas of interest: **Motion Capture from Sparse Observations (utilizing IMUs/VR/Radar technologies), Weakly-supervised Activity Segmentation, Motion Analysis for Health purposes, and Embodied Navigation**. If you share a passion for these fields or have expertise in related areas, I would love to connect. Please feel free to reach out to me via email at songpengchengxia@sjtu.edu.cn. Looking forward to potential collaboration opportunities. **I am also actively seeking faculty and suitable postdoctoral positions.**
